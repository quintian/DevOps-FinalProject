So far the only way seen for automatically installing tools and having the same configuration is copying the var/jenkins_home directory to a new jenkins instance. 
The new instance must be offline while you update it and then restarted. 
The credentials must be changed. For the purposes of Sonarqube setup, the user must provide a username and their sonarqube token.
Either using the jenkins cli (I had issues downloading this tool due to java version issues) 
or maybe by editng credentials file at var/jenkins_home/credentials.xml directly.
It seems the file's passwords are encrypted so cli is the better choice. You would need to delete all credentials inherited by the copy with delete-credentials before adding new credentials. 
The command for creating a credential is create-credentials-by-xml. The format for the sonarqube credential is 
```
<org.jenkinsci.plugins.plaincredentials.impl.StringCredentialsImpl plugin="plain-credentials@183.va_de8f1dd5a_2b_">
          <scope>GLOBAL</scope>
          <id>sonarqube</id>
          <description></description>
          <secret>{AQAAABAAAAAwzMIPUX8hlcM/MFzXzJsT01oJLhEQ0My/UJhrSudAZ4xBENSAcfttpmDbVWFBWbuMkgaiotB2CDMOZ9wh4txPbA==}</secret>
        </org.jenkinsci.plugins.plaincredentials.impl.StringCredentialsImpl>
```
Since you copied the whole folder you need to update teh github url in /var/jenkins_home/jobs/finalproject/config.xml as well.
The ids for credentials should be kept the same.
